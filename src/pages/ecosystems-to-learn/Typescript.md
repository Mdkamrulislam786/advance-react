### Typescript

Install: npm install -g typescript  
Typescript is a superset of Javscript which is used to define types of your JS code. It compiles your TS code to JS.

1. Catches error in developemnt
2. Only active during development.Runs in development only not in browser or in production. Has no efects on how our code gets executed by Browser or Node
3. Serves as documentation. Uses type anotation to analyze our code.
4. Dosent provide any performance issue

Type: easy way to differ to the diff properties + functions that a value has. TS knows what properties + functions that a value has thats why you get auto complete/suggesstions.

Type annotation: code we add to tell typescript what type of value a variable will refer to. We developer will tell the type to script. Use it when a var has a type that cant be inferenced, in function paramas, when var is declared only
Type inference: typescript figures out what type of value a var refres to. Typescript will use inference if the declaration and initialization are on the same line.

Remember: Type annotations never change the runtime behavior of your program.
